# News Web Application using React, TypeScript, Bootstrap

Welcome to the repository of the News Web Application built with React! This project serves as a platform for users to view up-to-date news from various sources.

## About the Project

The application is developed using the latest version of React and interacts with an open news API to fetch data. Users can easily browse news headlines and read full articles.

## Requirements

- React
- TypeScript
- API for fetching news data (NewsAPI)
- Bootstrap
- SCSS
- Git

## Key Features

- Displaying a list of news headlines
- Viewing full articles in fullscreen modal window with a link to the original source

## Additional Features

- Pagination with URL Search Params for browsing additional news articles

Due to the limitations imposed by the free API license, all pages of the pagination feature may display the same news articles.
